## Project Overview

Detailer was built with React, Express, and MongoDB. Being one of my first full-stack projects, I deliberately built it without any state management libraries. I made this choice because I wanted to have a first-hand account of the challenges that state management libraries such as Redux and Flux aimed to solve. For the backend, I decided to create a RESTful API using Express and MongoDB. Why MongoDB? I thought it was a good choice to get up and running quickly.
